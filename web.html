          It is one of the holiest sites in Christianity, believed to be the
          location of Jesus Christ's crucifixion, burial, and resurrection. From
          the ninth century onward, the construction of churches inspired by the
          Anastasis was extended across Europe. One example is Santo Stefano in
          Bologna, Italy, an agglomeration of seven churches recreating shrines
          of Jerusalem.

          The Church of All Nations (also known as the Basilica of the Agony) in
          Jerusalem. It is located on the Mount of Olives and commemorates the
          site where Jesus prayed before his arrest. The church was built
          between 1919 and 1924 using funds donated from many different
          countries. The coat-of-arms of twelve of the countries are
          incorporated into the ceiling, small dome, and also into the interior
          mosaics.

          The Great Omari Mosque, located in Bethlehem, is a significant
          religious and historical site. Constructed in the 12th century during
          the Crusades, it was built on the site of a Byzantine church dedicated
          to St. Mary. Named after Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab, who is known for
          his role , the mosque symbolizes the Islamic heritage of the region.
          Its architectural design features classic Islamic elements, including
          a spacious prayer hall and a prominent minaret, reflecting the styles
          typical of the era.

          The Church of the Nativity is one of the oldest continuously inhabited
          Christian churches in the world and holds great significance as the
          traditional birthplace of Jesus Christ. Located in Bethlehem, West
          Bank, it is a major pilgrimage site for Christians and a UNESCO World
          Heritage Site. The church was originally commissioned by Constantine
          the Great a short time after his mother Helena's visit to Jerusalem
          and Bethlehem in 325–326, on the site that was traditionally
          considered to be the birthplace of Jesus.

          the third holiest site in Islam after the Kaaba in Mecca and the
          Prophet's Mosque in Medina. It is believed to be the place where the
          Prophet Muhammad was transported during (Al Isra and Mi'raj) to the
          heavens. Before the Kaaba was designated as the qibla , Muslims
          originally faced Al-Aqsa during their prayers.
